  <article>
    <p>This is the last day of 2013. So it is the time for recapitulation.</p>

<p>What happend?</p>

<p>Well, first of all. I become a programmer. I was programming (with breaks) since I was a kid. But it was almost always just for the fun. I never took it seriously before.</p>

<p>But this year I&#39;ve found Ruby and I felt in love with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started to learn a lot. Not just Ruby, but everything related to programming. I want to be a better programmer. I love Ruby, but I do not want to be just Ruby programmer. I want to be a Programmer.</p>

<p>I want to have my eyes open. To learn everything what is good and forget what is bad. I want to master it. I want to master tools which I use.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve realized everything of this year. And next year I would like to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>So in 2014 I would like to join company where:</p>

<ul>
<li>we will stricly use TDD</li>
<li>we will do code reviews</li>
<li>we will pair from time to time</li>
<li>we will have open eyes and we will embrace the change</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome 2014!</p>
