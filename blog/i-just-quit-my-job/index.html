  <h1>I just quit my job</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Well, actually I did it yesterday. But today is my last day at it.</p>

<h4>What&#39;s next? I don&#39;t know yet!</h4>

<p>I have to say that this was my best job ever. It was my first fully remote job. I worked for <a href="https://www.procore.com/">Procore</a> via <a href="http://www.toptal.com/#work-with-only-spectacular-computer-engineers">Toptal</a>. I started more than a year ago. It was just a 5 days project. And well, it look that we were a good fit and we stayed together for more than a year.</p>

<p>And it was awesome! I learned a lot of new things which I could not learn just on my own, playing with my pet projects. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfjA-Vwx0pQ">I visited the USA</a> for two weeks thanks to the invitation from Procore. I had a lot of freedom. I could work whenever I wanted and from wherever I wanted. And oftentimes I could choose on which project I want to work. I was really independent.</p>

<p>Also, my boss was very supportive. I told him a few weeks ago that I am thinking about quitting. He accepted it without any issues and told me than I can quit anytime I want and that I can come back later if I want!</p>

<p>So overall this job was awesome! But there were these little things. Like a lot of them ;). The company is pretty big and it is still growing. But I prefer smaller companies and teams. I did not enjoy working on our oldest app with a lot of legacy code. Especially because it was not improving. Or maybe it was, but slowly. We were not a fully remote company. It means that there were still offline meetings and not always it was communicated to me. Etc...</p>

<p>So I decided to quit.</p>

<p>What&#39;s next? I don&#39;t know yet. There are two possible scenarios.</p>

<h4>New Job</h4>

<p>I had an job interview this week. I do not know yet if I am going to get that job or not. I should find out today, but I just don&#39;t know yet.</p>

<p>Anyway this job opportunity looks awesome. I would be the only engineer and work directly with the founder of the company. I enjoyed our job interview and I really hope that I get this job, because it looks exactly like a job which I want.</p>

<p>So this is the first option. If I get this job, then next I am going to fully focus on it and postpone all of my other side projects except this blog.</p>

<h4>Something else</h4>

<p>There is still possibility that I will not get that job. Ok. I still have like a thousand ideas what to do next. I just don&#39;t want to think about it right now.</p>

<p>If I do not get the job, then I will decide about my future project next week. My problem is that I tend to do a lot of things at once. Simple because I like to do something! But not this time. I will choose something what is important to me and I will focus solely on it. Be it a next job, writing a book, blog more... As I said, I don&#39;t know yet! And it is ok.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>That&#39;s it. I should find out today which option is it going to be. Hooray! :)</p>
